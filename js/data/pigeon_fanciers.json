        "description": "Frank Viola started his namesake homing pigeon club in the 1990s, along with the Frank Viola Invitational--a 400-mile race from Ohio to New York. Frank put up the $30,000 prize for a total of $200,000, and only won his own race once. “He was the only philanthropist in the pigeon world,” his wife Kathleen told the Brooklyn Paper.  Frank fought in World War II, then came home and helped build the World Trade Towers. Frank’s pigeons also fought in World War Two--flying messages across enemy lines. Since Frank’s death in October of 2007, the race is no longer held, but the club lives on with the help of Frank’s nephew, Peter.",
