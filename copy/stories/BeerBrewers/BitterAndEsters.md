# Bitter & Esters

At this do-it-yourself brewery you and up to five other people can make your very own signiture beer--and leave the mess in someone else's kitchen. Over the course of 3-4.5 hours, depending on the recipe, experts will guide you through the process of chosing and griding your hops, steeping them, mixing in the yeast, flavoring additions. For the downtime between steps, you're welcome to bring snacks and drinks and make the experience relaxed and social. Two to three weeks later you'll come back to carbonate, and bottle your beer that are ready to drink that day. For $400 you get the experience, plus 144 bottles of your very own brew--that's under $2.78 a beer.
