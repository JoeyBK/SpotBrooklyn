# Coney Island Brewing Company

The worlds smallest commercial brewery began one gallon at a time in a tiny shop owned by the company who runs the Coney Island Sideshow and the annual Mermaid Parade. The bottles featured sword swallower, Heather Holiday, human blockhead Danny Vomit, and snake charmer Stephanie Torres. A portion of every bottle went to maintaining the building and the coney island spirit. After Hurricane Sandy washed away much of the boardwalk, Coney Island brewing was sold to subsidiary of the company behind Sam Adams. Alan Newman, president of the subsidiary, who grew up in Coney Island, wants to play down the scary freakshow and celebrate the amusement park, the beach, boardwalk, hotdogs. They are going to restricit distribution to the New York metro market, and are looking for a new home for the brewery somewhere in Brooklyn.
