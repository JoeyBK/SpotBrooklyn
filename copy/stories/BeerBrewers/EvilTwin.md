# Evil Twin Brewing

Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø named his brewing company as a nod to his brother back in Denmark. Stories have casted the twins as rivals, and make it seem that there wasn't enough room in Denmark for the both of them. In TK year, Jeppe was a school teacher and brewing was a hobby, until he met the owner of Brooklyn beer distributor, 12 Percent Importants, who sold 20,000 litters, more than Jeppe's total previous output, and sold it in one day. Jeppe, his wife, and two kids moved with Evil Twin to Brooklyn. Jeppe is gypsie brewer because the contract time in other brewers, so you'll have to find Jeppe and his beers at the place he takes his meetings, Tørst, or Lucksus.
