# Grimm Artisanal Ales

Lauren and Joe Grimm first got the idea to brew their own beer during a talk about the importance of fermentation at Brown University, where they met. Soon after, the couple became addicted to the art of fermentation, starting with cucumbers, then kombhucha, hard cider, honey-wine, and finally beer. On a trip to Brussles, they discovered the Dibbles, Tripples, and Saisons of Belgium, and renewed their commitment to breewing beer. Then married, the couples new found commitments lead them to Brooklyn with the idea to open a brewery, but they couldn't get a loan. Instead the became as Joe calls it "nomadic brewers", (a term with less ethnic connotion than Gypsie brewer). They brew anywhere that's close enough to drive to, and make their recipes in their home kitchen and sell in keg form to beer bars around the city and state. The told Beer Advocate, “We want to focus on the special, idiosyncratic beers that we enjoy most, and join the ranks of the brewers who are expanding the definition of craft beer. The world doesn’t need us to make a standard American IPA.”
