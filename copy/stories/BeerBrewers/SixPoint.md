# Sixpoint Craft Ales

The six-pointed star has been used by mnay religions, in coats of arms, occult magic, and, in southern Germany, as the mark of a brewer. This practice, going back to at least the middle ages, may have represented the 6 elements of beer: water, malt, hops, fire, water, and air to combine into the hexagon. In alchemy this same symbol means great work. Six Point Craft Ales layered on more piece of symbolism onto their logo, the nautical star, to acknowledge the maritime histor of their host neighborhood, Red Hook.
